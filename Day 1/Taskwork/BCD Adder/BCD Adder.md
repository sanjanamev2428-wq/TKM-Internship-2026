A BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) Adder works by first adding two 4-bit BCD numbers using a standard binary adder to produce an intermediate sum. Because valid BCD digits only range from 0 to 9, any result greater than 9 or any addition that generates a carry-out (C_{out} = 1) is invalid in decimal math. To detect this, a set of combinational logic gates (two AND gates and an OR gate) monitors the intermediate sum and carry bit; if it detects an invalid state, it outputs a correction signal of 1. This signal is then fed into a second 4-bit adder, which automatically adds the binary value 0110 (decimal 6) to the intermediate sum to skip the 6 invalid binary states, successfully producing the correct 4-bit BCD sum and a final decimal carry-out.

## Result
The BCD Adder was successfully simulated and the expected output was obtained.
